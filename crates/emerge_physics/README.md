# Emerge Physics (Playground)

**Current Status**: Deprecated / Playground

This module is a sandbox for experimenting with custom physics utilities and extensions.  
For now, the engine uses `rapier2d` directly for all physics-related functionality.

**Future Scope**:
- If necessary, `emerge_physics` may serve as a layer for custom physics logic or eventual replacement of `rapier2d`.
- Currently, it's not actively used in the engine.
