# Emerge Math (Playground)

**Current Status**: Deprecated / Playground

This module is a sandbox for experimenting with custom math utilities and extensions.  
For now, the engine uses `nalgebra` directly for all math-related functionality.

**Future Scope**:
- If necessary, `emerge_math` may serve as a layer for custom math logic or eventual replacement of `nalgebra`.
- Currently, it's not actively used in the engine.
